Component for grouping together other components into a single interface. It manages the items positioning and radius, so they can create a uniform interface.

## Usage

Wrap elements you want to group within a `.group` block class and add to its direct children the `.group__item` element class.

[[example file=components/group/example/basic.html]]

### Overlapping items

As you can see in the basic example, borders of the items stack next to each other and don't create a coherent interface. Use `.group--overlap` modifier class to resolve this problem.

> Your grouped items have a thicker border? You can control the size of the overlap with a `$group-overlap` variable.

[[example file=components/group/example/overlaped.html]]

### Expanding items

Do you want to expand items to all available width? Leverage the `.group--expand` modifier class.

[[example file=components/group/example/expanded.html]]

### Stacking items

You can also tell a group to stack its items on top of each other with the `.group--stack` modifier class.
